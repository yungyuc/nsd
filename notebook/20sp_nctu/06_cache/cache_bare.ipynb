    "# Memory hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest model of computers, we write programs that process data in a linearly-addressed memory.  In reality, to achieve good runtime performance, the memory is hierarchical.  The programs we write still treat it like a linearly-addressed space, but by understanding the underneath hierarchical structure, we may get the most performance from the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to performance, we may be tempted to make all memory as fast as possible.  It is impractical because fast memory is very difficult to manufacture.  The economocally feasible approach is to keep the most frequently used data in the fastest memory, and the infrequently used data in slow and inexpensive memory.  When the work with the data is finished, they are removed from the fast memory, and other data are loaded to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory comes in many kinds in the hierarchy.  I put them in 4 categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CPU register file\n",
    "\n",
    "   The registers reside in the CPU circuits.  Instructions (machine code or assembly) can directly operate them and the electronic signals flow through the CPU circuits.  There is no delay in access time to registers.  They are the fastest memory.\n",
    "2. CPU cache\n",
    "\n",
    "   CPU cache memory works as a 'buffer' between the registers and the main memory.  It usually uses fast and expensive static random access memory (SRAM).  It is called static because the circuit keeps in one of the two stable states and access doesn't change the state.  The circuit takes more transistors than slower types of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The cache memory may be part of the CPU circuit or outside it.  A CPU usually has multiple levels of cache.  It can be a couple of MBs, or as large as tens or hundreds of MBs:\n",
    "   * Intel Xeon Platinum 9282 has 77MB L3 (56 cores): https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/intel/xeon_platinum/9282\n",
    "   * AMD EPYC 7H12 has 256MB L3 (64 cores): https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-epyc-7h12\n",
    "3. Main memory\n",
    "\n",
    "   Main memory is away from the CPU chip package.  It usually uses less expensive dynamic random access memory (DRAM).  The circuit takes more time to access the data but the lower cost allows much larger space.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Data in the main memory are lost when the system is powered off.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Mainstream PC uses DDR (double data rate) 4 SDRAM (synchronous dynamic random-access memory) with DIMM (dual in-line memory module) and its variants, e.g. RDIMM (registered DIMM) and LRDIMM (load reduced DIMM).  Depending on the CPU memory controller bandwidth, the data throughput may be around 60GB/s or higher.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   A powerful server may have up to 6TB of main memory:\n",

    "   * 256GB RDIMM/LRDIMM module: https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/dram/module/\n",
    "4. Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "   Data on the storage cannot be directly accessed by CPU instructions.  They need to be loaded to main memory and then the instructions can touch them.  The loading and saving operations are considered input and output (I/O).  Data in the storage are presisted when the system is powered off.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The storage is usually called the \"disks\", because it used to be hard-disk drives (HDD).  In a recent system the storage changes to use the solid-state drives (SSD), which use the flash memory instead of hard disk.\n",
    "   * Seagate Burracuda 510 SSD sequential read 3.45 GB/s, write 3.2 GB/s: https://www.seagate.com/internal-hard-drives/ssd/barracuda-ssd/\n",

    "# How cache works\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 ways to implement caches: (i) direct-map caches, (ii) set-associative caches, and (iii) fully-associative caches.  The direct-map caches are the simplest one and I will use it to show the basic concepts of caches.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the accessed byte is already in the cache, it's a hit, and CPU directly gets the byte from the cache.  If the byte is not in the cache, it's a miss, and the memory controller goes to the main memory to fetch the byte into cache, before CPU gets it.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the previous table, a cache miss is expensive.  When CPU can get data from cache, the latency is around a couple of cycles.  When there is a miss, additional hundreds of cycles are required to get the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two kinds of misses.  A cold miss happens when the requested byte is not in the cache.  The second kind is conflict miss, and happens when multiple cachable data claim the same cache block.  One set pops out the other, and vice versa, and each access is a miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume we have a main memory of 64 bytes (6-bit address is sufficient), and a cache of 8 bytes, let's use the following example to show how a cache works:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Access # | Decimal addr | Binary addr | Hit or miss | Cache block (binary) |\n",
    "| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |\n",
    "| 1 | 22 | 010110 | miss (cold) | 110 |\n",
    "| 2 | 26 | 011010 | miss (cold) | 010 |\n",
    "| 3 | 22 | 010110 | hit | 110 |\n",
    "| 4 | 26 | 011010 | hit | 010 |\n",
    "| 5 | 16 | 010000 | miss (cold) | 000 |\n",
    "| 6 | 18 | 010010 | miss (conflict) | 010 |\n",
    "| 7 | 26 | 011010 | miss (conflict) | 010 |\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a direct-map cache.  To reduce conflict misses, we may use multi-way set associativity.  2-, 4-, or 8-way set associative cache is commonly used.  Full associativity is too expensive in circuit implementation."

    "There are two kinds of locality: temporal and spatial.  Temporal locality means that a fixed address is reused in the near future.  Spatial locality means that the addresses close to the current address is reused in the near future.  The better locality, of either kind, improves the performance.  And the cache hierarchy is why locality works.\n",
    "\n",
    "To take advantage of locality, programmers analyze by using \"strides\".  A stride is the number of indexes to elements to slide when accessing the data in arrays.  The most basic striding is sequential access, or the 1-stride.  Similarly, we may have n-strides.  The larger the stride is, the worse the locality.\n",
