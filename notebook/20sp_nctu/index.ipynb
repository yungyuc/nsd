    "**Objectives**: This course discusses the art to build numerical software, i.e., computer programs applying numerical methods for solving mathematical or physical problems.  We will be using the combination of Python and C++ and related tools (e.g., [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), [git](https://git-scm.com), [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), etc.) to learn the modern development processes.  By completing this course, students will acquire the fundamental skills for developing modern numerical software.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites**:  This is a graduate or senior level course open to students who have taken computer architecture, engineering mathematics or equivalents.  Working knowledge of Linux and Unix-like is required.  Prior knowledge to numerical methods is recommended.  The instructor uses English in the lectures and discussions."
