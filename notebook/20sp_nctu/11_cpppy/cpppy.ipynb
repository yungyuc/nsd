    "# Why do we use scripting\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing is about commanding the computers to perform calculations to yeild the results that we want to see.  We want to delegate work to computers as much as possible, when the system performance remains feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the calculations, scripting plays an important role.  A general architecture of numerical software has the following layers, from high-level to low-level:\n",
    "\n",
    "* External result\n",
    "  * This is presented in a non-technical way to people outside the problem-solving team.  They can be stakeholders for business or general public.  The result has to be generated in some way, which may or may not be included in the numerical software we make.\n",
    "* Problem presentation: physics, math, or equations\n",
    "  * Users use the software or associated tools to present the technical result.\n",
    "* Scripting or configuration\n",
    "  * Users follow the example scripts to configure the problems to solve.  Configuration files may also be used.\n",
    "* Library interface\n",
    "  * This defines the application programming interface (API) for the numerical software.  Scripts should not touch anything below this layer.\n",
    "* Library structure\n",
    "  * This is where we architect the software.  Good book-keeping code is here to separate the interface and the computing kernel.  Data structures are designed at this layer to make sure no time is wasted in copying or converting data.\n",
    "* Computing kernel\n",
    "  * This is the place the does the heavy-lifting, and where we do most of the optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research code\n",
    "\n",
    "For a research code, the boundary between external result, problem presentation, and scripting, and that between library interface, library structure, and computing kernel, may be less clear.  The architecture is usually like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Problem presentation: high-level description, physics, and scripting / code configuration\n",
    "* Library implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "But sometimes if we don't pay attention to architecting, there may be no boundary between anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Full-fledged application\n",
    "\n",
    "For a commercial grade package, each of the layers will include more sub-layers.  It is a challenge to prevent those layers or sub-layers from interweaving.  From users' point of view, the sophistication appears in the problem presentation and the scripting layers.  Developers, on the other hand, take care of everything below problem presentation, so that users can focus on problem solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scripting for modularization\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, it should be clear that the scripting layer is the key glue in the system architecture.  The high-level users, who use the code for problem solving, wouldn't want to spend time in the low-level implementation.  Instead, they will specify the performance of the API exposed in the scripting layer.  The performance may be about the quality of result and runtime (including memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "The scripting layer can separate the programming work between the high-level problem presentation and the low-level library implementation.  A scripting language is usually dynamically typed, while for speed, the low-level implementation language uses static typing system.  In the dynamic scripting language, unit-testing is required for robustness.  In a statically typed language like C++, the compiler and static analyzers are very good at detecting errors before runtime.  But the great job done by the compiler makes it clumsy to use C++ to quickly write highly flexible code for problem presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is tempting to invent one programming language to rule them all.  That approach needs to convince both the high-level problem solvers and the low-level implementors to give up the tools they are familiar with.  The new language will also need to provide two distinct styles for both use cases.  It will be quite challenging, and before anyone succeeds with the one-language approach, we still need to live with a world of hybrid systems."
