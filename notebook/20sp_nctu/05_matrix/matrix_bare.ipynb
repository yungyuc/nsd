To perform multiplication, you need the memory for 3 of the matrices, and that's 240 GB.  The dense matrix multiplication generally cannot use distributed memory without significantly loss of runtime speed.  The reasonable size of dense matrices for a workstation is around $10,000\\times10,000$, i.e., 800 MB per matrix.  It's very limiting, but already facilitates a good number of applications."

Multiple vendors provide optimized implementation, e.g., Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL), Apple's vecLib, etc.\n",
