We sometimes need it since the refenrece cycle may not be as obvious as it is in our example.  For example, there may be 3 or 4 levels of references in the cycle.  `weak_ptr` has a similar interface to `shared_ptr`.  When we are troubleshooting resource-leaking issues, replacing `shared_ptr` with `weak_ptr` can work as a quick-n-dirty hotfix.\n",

The rule of thumb is that, as we mentioned earlier, you should avoid using `shared_ptr` unless you really need it.  And most of the time the need appears in a higher-level and heavy-weight container, rather than the lower-level small objects.  For small objects, we should try to limit the lifecycle and use raw pointers or stack."
